# pathmaker
A prototype to create a path of consecutive grid coordinates by clicking.

This is the beginning of a robust app to lay a square or hex grid over a game map and use it to generate a consecutive list of grid coordinates for movement. For example, a convoy in a naval game would have a pre-plotted list of grids or hexes to move generated by this app.

Eventually I want to integrate A* for auto path finding where yu click a starting grid and an eneding grid and the program caluculates the fastest most direct route.

Not sure if I want to do it with straight html or maybe switch to canvas. Don't know which one is more memory efficient.

Perhaps do this in Phone Gap for deployemnt to many devices.
